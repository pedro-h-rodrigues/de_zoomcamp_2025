âœ… venv (built-in virtual environments)
Why venv?

    âœ… Comes with Python â‰¥3.3 (no need to install anything)

    âœ… Lightweight and fast

    âœ… Works well with pip

    âœ… Ideal for managing dependencies per project

ðŸš€ How to Use venv
âœ… 1. Create a New Environment

Navigate to your project folder, then run:

python -m venv .venv

This creates a .venv folder containing a separate Python + pip installation.

âœ… 2. Activate the Environment
On Command Prompt (Windows):

.venv\Scripts\activate

On Git Bash:

source .venv/Scripts/activate

You'll see (.venv) in your prompt â€” now you're inside the environment.


âœ… 3. Install Packages (inside the env)

pip install pandas jupyter polars

These will be installed only inside .venv, not globally.


âœ… 4. Freeze Requirements (optional but recommended)

pip freeze > requirements.txt

This lets others (or future you) install the same environment via:

pip install -r requirements.txt

âœ… 5. Deactivate When Done

deactivate

This exits the virtual environment.
